This is a password Generator which was aimed to create simple logical passwords which are also safe.
Keeping in mind that most modern applications require a secure password with Uppercase, lowercase and alphanumeric value,
we often ease upon the convinience and thus loose the crux of having a password.

Purpose is to make it simple for normal users to generate secure passwords which are difficult to bruteforce or guess.
This takes a argument as a IV, it will prompt you for a website or username to make it more convinient unline existing password generator.
Allowing the user to customize this experience without any rigid arguments.

The module:
Formally, a rng is a set R with two binary operations (+, ·) called addition and multiplication such that

(R, +) is an abelian group,
(R, ·) is a semigroup,
Multiplication distributes over addition.
A rng homomorphism is a function f: R → S from one rng to another such that

f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)
f(x · y) = f(x) · f(y)
for all x and y in R.

If R and S are rings, then a ring homomorphism R → S is the same as a rng homomorphism R → S that maps 1 to 1.
All passowrds are displayed in plaintext with IV to make it convinient as well as secure.

All the code is tested and simulated before production and its cryptographically strong.
